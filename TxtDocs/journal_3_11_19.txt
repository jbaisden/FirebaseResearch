Didn't do any learning over the weekend. Had lots of other life things going on.

Today, I created a few blog drafts, read several articles, mostly finished up the Ionic 4 course (90%). 
I skimmed the section on firestore cloud messages as that's not yet relevant to my goals.

I plan to dig into Jekyll a bit more so I can add a few static pages to track learning and add reviews 
for the courses/tutorials I've gone through. I did update the about page on the blog to make things 
a bit more clear I'm not a noob at this, but also orient the blog as a Microsoft dev attempting to learn
new technologies.

BankPlus introduced LinkedIn learning for everyone, so I hopped on that band wagon.
