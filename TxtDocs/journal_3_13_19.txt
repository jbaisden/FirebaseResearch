I confess, I'm getting frustrated. I sat down to begin a project to test the firestore
learning I've gained. I ran into error and after error. Just stupid things. rxjs errors,
then some kind of strange error when duplicating code from jeff delaneys ionic course verbatim,
but what worked in his project didn't work in my tests.

I've started a new project from scratch, firestoretests. I'm not getting the errors I was, but now 
the firestore method calls appear to just not work at all.

**side note**
Had an app idea for a macro budget. It'd show all 12 months of the years on the lower half of the screen
and on the top half you can add expenses for big events like birthdays, taxes, christmas, weddings,
etc. It will then do a basic breakdown of the sum and show you how much you need to save
to cover everything.

Keep the math simple at first: savings needed = sum(costs) / 12
