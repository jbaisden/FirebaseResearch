Worked on LearningJournal project 

Began adjusting project to make LearningEntries a child of Goals\goalDoc. Found
that the level of nesting to get the Goal & LearningEntry object to the create/edit 
component is nuts.

Changing focus to get data where it needs to go via routing...which probably
should be what I did in the first place. Live and learn. And I thought I was 
so clever with that event emitter in the LearningEntry service...

Got some routing completed. Goals may be edited.
