Followed several more videos in the Ionic 4/Angular/Firestore course.

Considering https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ to manage my blog. This would let me create 
posts using markdown, publish to github for free, and manage posts via github 

Did quite a bit of work with Jekyll in the evening. Got everything set up locally. Got 
the github repo 'watchmelevelup' created (https://jbaisden.github.io/watchmelevelup/). 
Pushed the content to it, but it's not serving correctly. I'll continue to 
research the issue.
