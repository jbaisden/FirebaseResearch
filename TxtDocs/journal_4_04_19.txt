Worked on LearningJournal project 

Still trying to get the goal that applies to a learn note returned as part of the 
LearningEntry object. I did figure out how to get an individual document
from firestore, but it's still based on observables.

Created a debug component to test things. In this component, I was able to retrieve
a single goal document via hard coding the id for retrieval.

I decided at day's end to change the system structure. Since every Learning Entry 
must be associated with a Goal, LearningEntries will become a child collection of 
Goal collection documents.
