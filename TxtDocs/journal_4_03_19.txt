Note: https://www.concretepage.com/questions/634 as a fairly good resource. This
link explains the difference between map and switchMap. Use switchMap in conjunction
with debounceTime(ms). 

Good resource for succinct examples and explainations for 
RxJS operators. Might be dated in places, but is organized well.

"The scenarios to use switchMap are search functionality, accessing URL parameter etc."

Also added a Goals drop down to the Learning-Entry component in Learning Journal app.
