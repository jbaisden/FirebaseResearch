This entry may be off by a day or so, but I suppose it's getting the details written 
out that really matters.

So, goals can be edited. New notes can be created for specific goals and are 
done so as a child collection. I've been thinking about what the url
scheme should be and think i'm going with:

/goals - to list goals and the associated goal notes 
/goals/:goalid  - to edit/create goals
/goals/:goalid/learningEntries/:learningEntryId - to create/edit notes

I've got some wonky routing going on so despite my lists being 
short and my collections brief, there is notable lag on loading these 
components. I'm not really sure why exactly....but my guess is 
I'm destroying and recreating components on every url navigation instead of 
staying on a main component of some kind.

Furthermore, if I'm honest with myself, I could do this whole thing with just 
Learning Entries and Tags to represent goals because sometimes a single aspect 
of learning can work on more than one goal. Still, what's the fun in that? 

Let's over-engineer the heck out of this sucker!
