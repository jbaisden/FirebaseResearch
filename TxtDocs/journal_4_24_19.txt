Added route guards by making all routes children of the root and 
provided a guard via canActivateChild. Added auth service, auth, register, login
components.

Bottom line is functionality has been added so that any user that isn't
logged can't get to any route except auth/, auth/register, auth/login. This
makes sure the user signs in before they use the site. These details 
were blatantly copied from Max's Udemy course code. And I don't feel at all 
bad about that.

Also worked on cssgrid a good bit. That was kind of a tangent, but it's on the 
target list of things to learn so that's fine. See resource links at the top
for more reference.

There's still a lot to do in the app, but I'm taking it one day at a time. I do think
I'll end up redesigning the firestore collections yet again. This is so I can incorporate
the user id with the learning notes and goals and for other experiementation.
