Continued troubleshooting why my github pages jekyll repo isn't serving correctly.

Read over:
    https://github.com/github/pages-gem (update gem file per readme and run bundle install)
    https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites (check the source link to see how others
    implemented Jekyll in their repo)
    http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ Read over this again, but can't really go
    through it without blowing up my repo again as an account can only have 1 github pages site

I'll review these links tonight:
