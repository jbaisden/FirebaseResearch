So...it's been a while since I journaled. I got sick. Then I lost momentum in learning. Things 
are a bit stale in my brain atm. I'm already fighting anxiety that I'm reverting back to my
old habit of running away/burying my head in a game when the learning gets hard. I know
in my head that I have to push through this.

It's hard, though. There's so much to learn. So many dozens of practices I either should be 
using or feel I ought to know. So much time wasted and so much time hating myself for having
done so. And all of this leading to me being my own worst enemy self-esteem wise.

Okay. So I said it. It's out there. Now time to try and pick up the pieces and keep moving forward.

Notes: 

Tree Shakeable library means it's broken up into parts, like Rxjs, so you don't have to include all 
of it and can only include the bits you actually use.

In an async function, use the await keyword only once unless a later part of Code
depends on an awaited value from an earlier part of the async function
