Today I created user stories for the Learning Journal
application I'm creating to help me better understand how I want
it to function.

User can save journal entries
User can login via email and password
User can tag entries with tags
User can create tags
User can delete tags
User can register account
User can search entries by tag
User can search entries by text 
User can edit entries
User can delete entries
User can create goals
User can create Profile
User can provide an effort rating from 1 to 100 for entries
User can view stats page detailing what they've done
User can filter stats page via date
User can view resources page that shows any resources linked from their 
learning entries
User can add links to blogs, videos, courses, etc to their Profile


I'm seasawing once again on if my data model structure is the smartest choice. I thought
I wanted every entry tied to a goal and I kind of do, but it seems tagging would
work just as well. I'm also considering drawing a firm line between the two so the user
can keep their goals in mind and keep things focused, but not make that mandatory
for learning notes to be added.

I focused a bit on the routing to try and figure out how to force the user 
to be logged into the application without adding a route guard for EVERY SINGLE 
url in the app. I considered making a '' route point to the home component with ALL
other routes in the application as child routes so I could use canActivateChild
and have 1 guard apply for all of them. 

Despite today's entry being kind of long, most of the work done was thought work.
