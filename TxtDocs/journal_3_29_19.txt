I began implementing the Learning Journal project I thought up. I got crud working
for 2 different services which use 6 components altogether. Even wired up my first
event emitter with the service so one component can notify another for edit.

I'm pretty proud of the work I did today. My focus was a bit scattered so all of 
the work was over about a 2 hour period.

There's still plenty more to implement even aside from styling, which, once again,
I'm saving for later. I might go back on this decision though. I actually have 
a pretty good idea of the visuals I want for this project. Implementing those early
and seeing it all come together piece by piece may provide an accomplishment feel
that yields a more self-sustaining interest in the project.
