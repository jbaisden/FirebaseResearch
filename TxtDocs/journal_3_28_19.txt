Great resource on design rules for modals (hint: avoid them): https://modalzmodalzmodalz.com/#content

Made the following list of choices for next step to take in my 
learning (in no particular order):

* Material design
* Bootstrap 4
* Strongly Typing the Coffee Shop Demo
* App with multiple forms and multiple firestore collections
* App focusing on getting Google Auth / Auth Guard / authentication down
* Enhance Blog with someway to have an activity tracker...i.e. sort of 
move these journals into the blog, but in a way that's easy to create
list of videos watched, articles read, and notes taken.
    * Make an angular app that implements the above point and provides
    a variety of ways to view/filter the information
