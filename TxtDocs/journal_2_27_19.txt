to go through.

I figured this is a good point to summarize my work and what issues I'm facing.

Goal: Get basic CRUD operations working against a simple FireStore database within an angular project.

Issue: The Firestore web sdk is javascript based. I'm trying to find some example that illustrates
how to use it within an Angular project. I've tried a few things with the REST API and they
seem to work alright, but I'm kind of shocked that there doesn't seem to be a native fully supported
Google produced library for working with Firestore within Angular. 

I've found AngularFire2, but I'm not sure if this is "google backed" or produced by a third party
that may tire of developing the library. I've also tried "npm install @angular/fire firebase --save" as
part of a demo project, but that doesn't seem to be working (the demo app that is).

I found the slack community for firebase here: https://firebase-community.slack.com/messages/C7CQWAH7F/
and asked for help there.

FOUND IT!!!!

The basic demo app was hiding right in front of me. It's right in the bloody 
AngulreFire2's repo readme on github. Furthermore, when actually reading over the 
repo it clearly says "The official Angular library for Firebase."

The link to it is here: https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/blob/master/docs/install-and-setup.md

Steps:

1) Create basic angular project 
2) Edit the src/environments/environment.ts file with Fire Store info like apiKey, authDomain, 
databaseURL, etc taken from the your app console.
3) run: npm install firebase @angular/fire --save
4) Follow steps in readme beginning with step 5
