More resources...really good resources

Angular/firebase Portfolio Tutorial

Super in depth angular training. 
Note to self: 
    I need to make more basic things before 
    taking on yet another training course, I think. It just feels like the concepts 
    I've come to learn in Angular are only loosely formed in my minds eye. Get the 
    basics before hitting the advanced stuff, in other words. One thing this training
    does cover in a good amount of depth is testing. I've not seen any resources 
    anywhere to date that cover this.

Resource Roundup for Angular Roadmap 2019
Note: Apparently I spoke too soon about testing resources. About 3/4 of the way
down are several resources for testing.

As for actual work done: more research. I've found out how to cast 
the firestore Timestamp to a Date, but in the getLearningEntries call, which is
strongly typed, I'm having issues figuring out where to apply the cast.

I'm also looking at the ckeditor rich text component and wondering if I can 
get the data in the control without the html. If so, I could just add another property
to the document - one for formatted data and another for raw text.
