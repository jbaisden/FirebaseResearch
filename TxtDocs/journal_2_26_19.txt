Reviewing more videos about Firebase. Seeing more and more info
about Cloud Firestore, which seems to be the next Firebase product that will likely
superceed the Firebase realtime database structure, but even though this is being pushed
even directly from the Firebase console, the realtime database functionality is no where
near being phased out. It's more likely I've misinterpreted the point of these products
and they solve slightly different customer needs. 

Reviewing article at https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-firebase/

And here: https://devdactic.com/ionic-4-firebase-angularfire/

and https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rtdb-vs-firestore

and https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart

and 

    wtf!!!! Do I use firebase or firestore???????????? ARGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! And do I use 
    just http rest api or an angular package? If a package what package? Firebase & Firestore
    both have a Web sdk, but angular is in typescript so how the heck does that work????

Possibly a good article here https://medium.com/@coderonfleek/firebase-firestore-and-angular-todo-list-application-d0fe760f6bca

Created new project: ToDoDemoAngularfirestore

<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/5.8.4/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize Firebase
  var config = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyAYCpMk5pAkY7kn9iK85xBEvBuwEWFGOwQ",
    authDomain: "tododemoangularfirestore.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://tododemoangularfirestore.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "tododemoangularfirestore",
    storageBucket: "",
    messagingSenderId: "599332338681"
  };
  firebase.initializeApp(config);
</script>

Left off with cloning the project needing to: https://github.com/coderonfleek/angular-firebase
