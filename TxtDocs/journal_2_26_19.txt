Reviewing more videos about Firebase. Seeing more and more info
about Cloud Firestore, which seems to be the next Firebase product that will likely
superceed the Firebase realtime database structure, but even though this is being pushed
even directly from the Firebase console, the realtime database functionality is no where
near being phased out. It's more likely I've misinterpreted the point of these products
and they solve slightly different customer needs.
