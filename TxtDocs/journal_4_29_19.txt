Completed several videos on fireship.io's data modeling in firestore course.

Not sure I really understand things better as of yet.

Reviewing Learning Journal to try and get a better idea of what the 
sites functionality should encompass. I'm putting my todo list here.

Okay, I've thought about this a good bit and think I have a layout for the home page
that will enforce an architecture to guide how the system will function. Sadly, I
can't put images in txt documents, but it's on my phone. The details that I've 
arrived at from this thought process are these:

Learning Notes will be their own collection
Goals will be their on collection
Tags will be its own collection
Goal might possibly have a sub-collection, Goal-Steps
A collection will be created to allow cross referencing Notes with Goals

The layout itself will make a really good exercise in CSS. It has
a menu/header/title bar at the top followed by a search bar below it,
with a section showing Learn Notes on the left and Goals on the right,
with a tag cloud below that making up the footer.

The plan is to animate it such that when +Note or +Goal is clicked,
all the space below the header bar is utilized. So for +Note, we'd see
the Learning notes area grow to the right (hiding the goals) and down (hiding the tags)
and the Search bar above it would become the Title field where the cursor will then
be focused.
