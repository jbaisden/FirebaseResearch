Review a number of videos about Firebase Realtime database, mostly those from
Academind where he's talking with Abe Haskins. Also reviewed some videos 
by the Firebase channel itself on youtube.

I also had the realization that, once more, hilariously so, I've been going about pursuing
Firebase the wrong way. I was working on implementing it or figuring out an implementation that was 
strictly REST api based, hence, the work with PostMan. This effort was definitely not wasted as it 
yielded a lot of information about how the documents work, how the storage can be organized, etc, etc.

The takeway here is that I'm realizing that it's the intent of Google and the Firebase 
devs for the developer to use the pertinent Firebase sdk for their platform. In my case,
I need to transition focus to the Angular Firebase sdk and not so much the rest api.

Another big takeaway from this API is that with the sdk, if you get a "collection" from the 
realtime database, it will return that document and EVERYTHING nested beneath that document.
