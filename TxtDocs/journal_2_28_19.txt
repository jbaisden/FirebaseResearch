Watched videos on maps and how to structure your data 

Because firestore charges for read/writes, the client list and other data on the main scroll screen for 
my app may need to be added to the user document itself. That's premature optimization at this 
time, however.

So after a plethora of googling, searching, hair pulling, screaming, head banging,
face palming, and other things that happen when trying to look for things, solve problems,
manage confusion, etc, etc, I've landed upon a few facts that ought to have been obvious
to me from the beginning:

#1) Product documentation is king. Go through it first. That said, parsel your time out,
as products normally have several resources for support. Which brings us to:

#2) If a product is public and has a GitHub repo, CHECK THE F*KING readme files. Consider 
these as grade A product documentation. AngularFire has a whole bloody tutorial built in that 
links from one readme to another, etc.

#3) YOUTUBE!!!!!! If you see a video embedded in documentation, hit it up on youtube. From 
here, note the channel of the video and see what other videos are in the same playlist. after
that, expand up. The video may be a child series in a larger product series of videos.

Overviews, sample code, high and low level explainations are all likely covered by the above 3
points.

#4) Google tutorials. This is a crapshot and possibly a waste of time initially. If you're new
to a technology, you have no idea what makes a good article different than a bad article as 
far as the technical acumen. Additionally, the date of a tutorial matters. A tutorial from 
2017 will probably not be 100% reproduceable without tweaks that you will have to figure out
on your own, most likely.

I made the above into a blog post and began another blog post as well.

Research cloud functions to calculate next appt for the client list of a user.

Once again noting: https://angularfirebase.com/pro/ and 
https://projects.angularfirebase.com/p/ionic-4-firebase-master-course which may 
be the perfect courses for what I'm looking to do.

Oh, wow...Firestore auth rules allow for the declaration and use of functions
